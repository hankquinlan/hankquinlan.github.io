Introduction
============
It was great to get back to an IRL conference after nearly two years. The Data Science Festival Live 2021 took place at Code Node, South Place just off Moorgate in London on 27th November 2021. It was equally wonderful to be back at Skills Matter for the first since its resurrection.

In what follows, the descriptions are from the talks I personally went to, following my particular interests.

The full agenda is attached at the bottom of this post.
